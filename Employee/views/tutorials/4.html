            <p><span style="color: #336699; font-size: 22pt"><b>3.</b></span>The Sales Info tab. The app gives you an option to enter up to two Registers for MOP Sales, which stands for Method of Payment. In addition, you will be able to enter the total MOP Sales for All Registers. If you don't have more than one register, you may either enter in your sales in just All Registers or complete both for Register 1 and All Registers. If you have worked on more than 2 registers during your shift, you should leave the fields in Register 1 and Register 2 empty and simply complete the fields in All Registers. </p>

            <span style="color: red; font-size: 15pt">*It is very important to understand that regardless if you and your manager decide to use the fields in Register  1 and 2 , you must at least complete the fields in All Registers. If you have any questions how to enter your sales for different Register fields, please consult with your Manager.*</span>

            <p><span style="color: #336699; font-size: 22pt"><b>4.</b></span>The MOP Sales are composed of credit, debit, and cash sales. You enter in the dollar value that's listed on your register shift report receipt into the appropriate Register. For example, if I had 100.55 dollars on register 1 for credit sales i enter it in like so, and the same for debit and cash sales. In this case, I still must complete the fields in All Registers so I will also enter in 100.55 dollars on All registers in the credit field. </p>
